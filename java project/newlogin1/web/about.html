    <h2>Our story begins with you</h2><br>
<h4>
    Quikr is all about you - Our aim is to empower every person in the country to independently connect with buyers and sellers online. Brainchild of Pranay Chulet, Quikr is widely known as <br><br>India’s no. 1 online classifieds platform - and there’s a reason behind that. We care about you - and the transactions that bring you closer to your dreams. Want to buy your first car? We’re here<br><br>for you. Want to sell commercial property to buy a home for your family? We’re here for you. Whatever job you’ve got, we promise to get it done.<br><br>

       Founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bangalore, Quikr has left a memorable footprint in over 1000 cities. And we continue<br> <br>to work towards building the future of trading and e-commerce.

       In 2014 we raised about $150 million split into different sources - In a financing round led by Tiger Global, we raised <br><br>$90 million, and in yet another round led by Kinnevik, we raised $60 million. Till now, Quikr has raised $350 million in 7 rounds, to fulfill the dream of disrupting the Indian e-commerce market to enable and empower people.<br><br>
We’ve had the good fortune to be backed by some of the world’s most reputed investment giants. The road to our milestones was paved with the support of Kinnevik, Matrix Partners India, Omidyar Network, Norwest Venture Partners, Nokia Growth Partners, Warburg Pincus and eBay Inc.
